feat: implement comprehensive traffic obfuscation settings & monitoring screen

Implemented a full-featured Traffic Obfuscation Settings & Monitoring screen with:

Settings Features:
- Mode control (Standard/Maximum with auto-switch rules)
- Schedule editor (24/7, specific hours, business/night presets)
- Battery saver with configurable threshold
- Network quality awareness
- Data cap warnings with usage tracking
- Historical statistics (session/today/week)

Monitoring Features:
- Live packets/sec graph with 30-point rolling window
- Resource usage bars (CPU, memory, battery) with color coding
- Bandwidth ratio visualization (inbound/outbound)
- Model performance metrics (accuracy, latency)
- Tor connection pool status (active circuits)
- Error log with timestamps

Technical Implementation:
- ObfuscationConfigService: Persistent settings storage via JsonStore
- ObfuscationMonitorService: Aggregates metrics from TorManager & SmartAgent
- Event bus integration: 3 new event types for real-time updates
- 6 custom widgets: ResourceBar, PacketsGraph, BandwidthVisualization, etc.
- ObfuscationSettingsScreen: Responsive 2-column layout with 10 cards

Performance Optimizations:
- Throttled updates (2.5s intervals) for battery efficiency
- Canvas caching for graph rendering
- Rolling data windows (limited history)
- Batched event emissions

All acceptance criteria met:
✅ Settings persist via config service
✅ Monitoring charts update smoothly without FPS degradation
✅ Warnings when thresholds hit
✅ Historical stats populate from mock history store
✅ Graphs optimized for low-power devices

Files added:
- src/services/obfuscation_config_service.py
- src/services/obfuscation_monitor_service.py
- src/widgets/obfuscation_widgets.py
- src/screens/obfuscation_settings_screen.py
- test_obfuscation.py (comprehensive test suite)
- OBFUSCATION_SETTINGS_README.md (detailed documentation)
